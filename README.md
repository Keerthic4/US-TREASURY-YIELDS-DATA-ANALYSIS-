# US-TREASURY-YIELDS-DATA-ANALYSIS-
During this project got an idea about US treasury yields for multiple tenors.

In python we are mainly using six libraries- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy, statsmodels.

Logistic Distribution fits better than Normal Distribution for all the increments

Identified that there are correlations between 1 day and 25 day increment for multiple tenors by Pearson's method.

SARIMA Stochastic Model is implemented to predict Yields.

Future Scope: To implement Stochastic model like Geometric Brownian motion for predicting yields.
